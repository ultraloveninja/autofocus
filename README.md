# Autofocus Theme

This theme was originally created and published by [Allan Cole](https://github.com/allancole).

It has been one of my favorite "open" themes for WordPress. I had originally used this theme for my personal site some years ago, but as time passed I flipped between other theme favoring more of the responsive nature. However, as I start to go back, there hasn't been a theme as well designed as this one that I've come across as of late.

So, I was able to dig this up from an archive that I had and I'm currently taking it upon my self to update it.

This will be slow, as well as personal, so I'm not expecting anything overly epic from the start.
